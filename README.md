# earthquake-precursors-ssf
Python implementation of the Shakibay Senobari frequency-domain transform (SSf) for detecting earthquake precursors in noise.

Project Note: This code implements the Shakibay Senobari frequency-domain transform (SSf), a method that may contribute to saving lives by enabling real-time monitoring of fault stress changes from seismic noise.

Research use: Please share this repository and use it freely for non-commercial scientific purposes. If you use SSf in your research, kindly cite the associated paper:
[Submitted to Science Advances, arXiv DOI: 	arXiv:2509.00268, https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2509.00268].

Commercial use: Commercial applications of this method are protected under U.S. Patent Pending 63/870,020 (“Methods and Systems for Detecting Earthquake Precursors via Stress-Sensitive Transformations of Seismic Noise”).

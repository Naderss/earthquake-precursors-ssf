# earthquake-precursors-ssf
Python implementation of the Shakibay Senobari frequency-domain transform (SSf) for detecting earthquake precursors in noise.

💡 Project Note

This code implements the Shakibay Senobari frequency-domain transform (SSf), a method that may contribute to saving lives by enabling real-time monitoring of fault stress changes from seismic noise.
